Reasoning: 
I made a separate checkUniq function in order to avoid duplicates. This recursively counted
the number of instances of a data value, and if it was greater than 0, it would not be added.
Otherwise, I merely defined every other given function in the file header mostly through recursive
methods with the exception of the addChild and addSibling functions, which mandated that I parsed
through the tree and determine from there if conditions were correct for adding a new node.
